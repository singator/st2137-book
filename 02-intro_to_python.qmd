## Introduction

Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is a higher-level language
than C, C++ and Java in the sense that a Python program does not have to be
compiled before execution.

It was originally conceived back in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum
Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. The language is named after a
BBC TV show (Guido’s favorite program) “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, not the 
snake!

Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. Python 2.0 was released on October
16, 2000. Python 3.0, which is backwards-*incompatible* with earlier versions,
was released on 3 December 2008.

Python is a very flexible language; it is simple to learn yet is fast enough to 
be used in production. Over the past ten years, more and more comprehensive data 
science toolkits (e.g. scikit-learn, NLTK, tensorflow, keras) have been written 
in Python and are now the standard frameworks for those models. 

Just like R, Python is an open-source software. It is free to use and extend.

## Installing Python and Jupyter Lab

To install Python, navigate to the official 
[Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to obtain the 
appropriate installer for your operating system. 

::: {.callout-important}
For our class, please ensure that you are using at least Python 3.12, and that 
you have installed the package versions in `requirements.txt`.
:::

The next step is to create a virtual environment for this course. Virtual 
environments are specific to Python. They allow you to retain multiple versions 
of Python, and of packages, on the same computer. Go through the videos on Canvas
relevant to your operating system to create a virtual environment and install 
Jupyter Lab on your machine.

Jupyter notebooks are great for interactive work with Python, but more advanced
users may prefer a full-fledged IDE. If you are an advanced user, and are
comfortable with an IDE of your own choice (e.g. Spyder or VSCode), feel free to
continue using that to run the codes for this course. 

::: {.callout-important}
Even if you are using Anaconda/Spyder/VSCode, you still need to create a virtual
environment, and you still need to install packages using the `requirements.txt`
file.
:::

Jupyter notebooks consist of cells, which can be of three main types: 

* code cells,
* output cells, and 
* markdown cells. 

![Py: JupyterLab interface](figs/jupyter_lab2.png){#fig-jupyter fig-alt="Jupyter Lab" fig-align="center"}

In @fig-jupyter, the red box labelled 1 is a markdown cell. It can be used to
contain descriptions or summary of the code. The cells in the box labelled 2 are
code cells. To run the codes from our notes, you can copy and paste the codes
into a new cell, and then execute them with Ctrl-Enter. 

Try out this Easter egg that comes with any Python installation:

```{python}
import this

```

More information on using Jupyter notebooks can be obtained from 
[this link](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html). 

## Basic Data Structures in Python

The main objects in native[^02-python-1] Python that contain data are

[^02-python-1]: i.e., Python without any packages imported.

* **Lists**, which are defined with [ ]. Lists are mutable.
* **Tuples**, which are defined with ( ). Tuples are immutable.
* **Dictionaries**,  which are defined with { }. Dictionaries have keys and 
  items. They are also mutable.
  
Very soon, we shall see that for statistics, the more common objects we shall
deal with are dataframes (from pandas) and arrays (from numpy). However, the
latter two require add-on packages; the three object classes listed above are
baked into Python.

Here is how we create lists, tuples and dictionaries. Elements in lists and
tuples can be accessed using a square bracket notation, just like in R.

```{python create-obj}
x_list = [1, 2, 3]
x_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
x_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} # access with x_dict['a']
```

Suppose we have the following list:
```{python}
x = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

The following assignment is OK, because `x` is a list, and hence mutable.
```{python mutable-1}
x[3] = 17     
print(x)  
```

However, the following will return an error, because `x_tuple` is a tuple, and
hence immutable.
```{python mutable-2}
#| eval: false
x_tuple = (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10)
x_tuple[3] = 17 
```

::: {.callout-note}
Note that we do *not* need the `c( )` function, like we did in R. This is a 
common mistake when switching between the two languages.
:::

## Slice Operator in Python

One important point to take note is that, in contrast to R, Python indexes
objects starting with 0. Second, the slice operator in Python is a little more
powerful than in R. It can be used to extract regular sequences from a list,
tuple or string easily.

In general, the syntax is `<list-like object>[a:b]`, where `a` and `b` are integers. 
Such a call would return the elements at indices `a`, `a+1` until `b-1`. Take note that 
the end point index is not included.

```{python slice-1}
char_list = ['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
char_list[0]           # returns first element
char_list[-1]          # returns last element
len(char_list)         # returns number of elements in list-like object.
char_list[::2]         # from first to last, every 2 apart.
```

This indexing syntax is used in the additional packages we are going to use as
well, so it is good to know about it. Take note that in Python, a negative index
does not correspond to the element being dropped; it corresponds to counting
from the end of the array-like object. @fig-py-slice displays a pictorial
representation of how positive and negative indexes work together.

![Py: Positive and negative indexing](figs/python_slice.png){#fig-py-slice fig-alt="Python slice" fig-align="center" width="55%"}

## Numpy Arrays

Just like R, Python has several contributed packages that are essential for
statistics and data analysis. These include `numpy` and `pandas`. These correct
versions of these packages would have been installed if you had used the provided
requirements file.

```{python np-1}
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
matrix1 = np.array([array1, array2])
print(matrix1)
```

The slice operator can then be used in each dimension of the matrix to subset it. 

```{python np-2}
matrix1[0, 0::3]       # returns first row, columns 1 and 4
matrix1[1, 1:3]        # returns second row, columns 2 and 3
```

The numpy arrays are objects in Python, with several attributes and methods
associated with them. Here are a couple of attributes:

```{python np-3}
# To obtain the dimensions of an array:
matrix1.shape
# To transpose a 2-D array
matrix1.T
```

Here is a table with some common methods associated with numpy arrays. 
The objects referred to in the second column are from the earlier lines of code.

| Method      | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `mean`      | Computes col- or row-wise means, e.g. `matrix1.mean(axis=0)` or `matrix1.mean(axis=1)` |
| `sum`       | Computes col- or row-wise means, e.g. `matrix1.sum(axis=0)` or `matrix1.sum(axis=1)` |
| `argmax`    | Return the index corresponding to the max within the specified dimension, e.g. `matrix1.argmax(axis=0)` for the position with the max within each column.  |
| `reshape`   | To change the dimensions, e.g. `array1.reshape((5,1))` converts the array into a 5x1 matrix |

To combine arrays, we use the functions `vstack` and `hstack`. These are analogous to 
`rbind` and `cbind` in R.

```{python np-4}
np.vstack([matrix1, array1])

np.hstack([array1.reshape((5,1)), 
           array2.reshape((5,1)),
           matrix1.T])
```

## Pandas DataFrames

The next important add-on package that we shall work with is `pandas`. It provides a
`DataFrame` class of objects for working with tabular data, just like `data.frame` 
within R. However, there are some syntactic differences with R that we shall soon
get to. The following command creates a simple pandas dataframe.

```{python pd-1}
import pandas as pd

data = {'X': [1,2,3,4,5,6], 'Y': [6,5,4,3,2,1]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns =['X', 'Y'])
print(df)
```

We will get into the syntax for accessing subsets of the dataframe soon, but for 
now, here is how we can extract a single column from the dataframe. The resulting
object is a pandas Series, which is a lot like a 1-D array, and can be indexed 
like one as well.

```{python pd-2}
col_x = df.X
col_x[0:3]
```

::: {.callout-note}
The built-in objects in Python are lists, tuples and dictionaries. Lists and
tuples can contain elements of different types, e.g. strings and integers in a
single object. However, they have no dimensions, so to speak of. Numpy arrays
can be high-dimensional structures. In addition, the elements have to be
homogeneous. For instance, in a 2x2x2 numeric numpy array, every one of the 8
elements has to be a float point number. Pandas DataFrames are tabular objects,
where, within a column, each element has to be of the same type.
:::

## Reading Data into Python {#sec-01-read-data-py}

Let us begin with the same file that we began with in the topic on R: `crab.txt`. 
In @sec-01-read-data, we observed that this file contained headings, 
and that the columns 
were separated by spaces. The `pandas` function to read in such text files 
is `read_table()`. It has numerous optional arguments, but in this case we just 
need these two:

```{python read-1}
data1 = pd.read_table('data/crab.txt', header=0, sep="\\s+")
data1.head()
```

Do take note of the differences with R - the input to the header argument 
corresponds to the line number containing the column names. Secondly, the `head()`
function is a method belonging to the DataFrame object.

When the file does not contain column names, we can supply them (as a list 
or numpy array) when we read the data in. Here is an example:

```{python read-2}
varnames = ["Subject", "Gender", "CA1", "CA2", "HW"]
data2 = pd.read_table('data/ex_1.txt', header=None, 
                      names=varnames, sep="\\s+")
data2
```

## Subsetting DataFrames with Pandas

DataFrames in pandas are indexed for efficient searching and retrieval. When 
subsetting them, we have to add either `.loc` or `.iloc` and use it with square 
brackets.

The `.loc` notation is used when we wish to index rows and columns according 
to their names. The general syntax is `<DataFrame>.loc[ , ]`. A slice operator 
can be used separately for the row subset and the column subset to be retrieved.

For instance, to retrieve rows 0,1,2 and columns from color to width:
```{python subset-1}
data1.loc[0:2, 'color':'width']
```

To retrieve every second row starting from row 0 until row 5, and all columns:
```{python subset-1a}
data1.loc[0:5:2, ]
```

The `.iloc` notation is used when we wish to index rows and columns using integer
values. The general syntax is similar; try this and observe the difference with
`.loc`.

```{python subset-2}
data1.iloc[0:2, 0:2]
```

If you notice, the `.iloc` notation respects the rules of the in-built slice
operator, in the sense that the end point is *not* included in the output. On
the other hand, the `.loc` notation includes the end point.

In data analysis, a common requirement is to subset a dataframe according to 
values in columns. Just like in R, this is achieved with logical values.

```{python subset-3}
data2[data2.Gender == "M"]

data2[(data2.Gender == "M") & (data2.CA2 > 85)]
```

## Loops in Python

It is extremely efficient to execute "for" loops in Python. Many objects in Python
are *iterators*, which means they can be iterated over. Lists, tuples and dictionaries
can all be iterated over very easily. 

Before getting down to examples, take note that Python does not use curly braces
to denote code blocks. Instead, these are defined by the number of indentations 
in a line. 

```{python iter-1}
for i in x[:2]:
  print(f"The current element is {i}.")
```

Notice how we do not need to set up any running index; the object is just iterated 
over directly. The argument to the `print()` function is an f-string. It is the 
recommended way to create string literals that can vary according to arguments.

Here is another example of iteration, this time using dictionaries which have
key-value pairs. In this case, we iterate over the keys.

```{python iter-2}
dict1 = {'holmes': 'male', 'watson': 'male', 'mycroft': 'male', 
         'hudson': 'female', 'moriarty': 'male', 'adler': 'female'}
# dict1['hudson']

for x in dict1.keys():
    print(f"The gender of {x} is {dict1[x]}")
```

In @sec-r-loops, we wrote a block of code that incremented an integer until the 
square was greater than 36. Here is the Python version of that code:

```{python iter-3}
x = 0          
test = True 

while test:
    x += 1  
    test = x < 6
    print(f"{x**2:2d}, {test}")
```

It is also straightforward to write a for-loop to perform the above, since we
know when the break-point of the loop will be. The `np.arange()` function
generates evenly spaced integers.

```{python iter-4}
for y in np.arange(1, 7):
    print(f"The square of {y} is {y**2:2d}.")
```

## User Defined Functions

The syntax for creating a new function in Python is as follows:
```{python user-fn-1}
#| eval: false
def fn_name(arguments):
  Python statements
  ...
  Returned object
```

Here is the Python version of the function from earlier, computing the
circumference of a circle with a given radius.

```{python user-fn-2}
import math

def circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius 

circumference(1.3)
```

## Miscellaneous

### Package installation

So far, we have used numpy and pandas, but we shall need to call upon a few 
other add-on packages we proceed in the course. These include statsmodels, scipy and 
matplotlib. 

### Getting help

Most functions in Python are well-documented. In order to access this 
documentation from within a Jupyter notebook, use the `?` operator. For more 
details, including the source code, use the `??` operator.  For instance, 
for more details of the `pd.read_csv()` function, you can execute this command:

```{python get-help-1}
#| eval: false
pd.read_csv?
```

The internet is full of examples and how-to's for Python; help is typically just 
a Google search or a chatGPT query away. However, it is always better to learn 
from the ground up instead of through snippets for specific tasks. Please look
through the websites in @sec-web-ref-02 below.

## Major Differences with R

Before we leave this topic, take note of some very obvious differences with R:

1. The assignment operator in R is `<-`; for Python it is `=`.
2. When creating vectors in R, you will need `c( )`, but in Python, this is 
   not the case.
3. R implements it's object oriented mechanism in a different manner from Python.
   For instance, when plotting with R, you would call `plot(<object>)` but in 
   Python, you would call `<object>.plot()`. In Python, the methods belong to the
   class, but not in R.

## Exercises

1.  Write a Python function to return the area of a circle. It should take the 
    radius as the input argument.
2.  Refer to `data1` from  @sec-01-read-data-py. Use logical indexing to retrieve 
    all rows corresponding to `color` equals 2, or `spine` equals 1.
3.  Consider once more, the dataframe `data1` from @sec-01-read-data-py. Complete 
    the following code to result in the output that follows. The output corresponds 
    to rows where `satell` is greater than 10.
```{python}
#| eval: false

for z in data1.iterrows():
    if _____ > 10:
        print(_____)
```
```{python}
#| echo: false

for z in data1.iterrows():
    if z[1]['satell'] > 10:
        print(f"Row {z[0]}: The weight is {z[1]['weight']}")
```

4.  Use the slice operator, along with `.iloc` or `.loc`, to return every second 
    row from `data1`.
5.  What does the following code do? How different is it from a conventional loop
    in Python?
```{python}
#| eval: false
olist = [dict1[x] for x in dict1.keys()]
```
