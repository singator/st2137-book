Examples of categorical variables are: gender,\nreligion, race and type of residence.\n\nCategorical variables are typically modeled using discrete random variables,\nwhich are strictly defined in terms whether or not the support is countable. The\nalternative to categorical variables are quantitative variables, which were introduced \nin the previous chapter.\n\nAnother method for distinguishing between quantitative and categorical variables\nis to ask if there is a meaningful distance between any two points in the data.\nIf such a distance is meaningful then we have quantitative data. For instance,\nit makes sense to compute the difference in systolic blood pressure between\nsubjects, but it does not make sense to consider the mathematical operation\n(\"smoker\" - \"non-smoker\").\n\nIt is important to identify which type of data we have (quantitative or\ncategorical), since it affects the exploration techniques that we can apply.\n\nThere are two sub-types of categorical variables:\n\n-   A categorical variable is *ordinal* if the observations can be ordered, but\n    do not have specific quantitative values.\n-   A categorical variable is *nominal* if the observations can be classified\n    into categories, but the categories have no specific ordering.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall discuss techniques for identifying the presence, and for\nmeasuring the strength, of the association between two categorical variables. We\nshall also demonstrate common visualisations used with categorical data.\n\n## Contingency Tables\n\n::: {#exm-chest-pain style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Chest Pain and Gender\n\n\\index{Chest pain!description}\n\nSuppose that 1073 NUH patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) were randomly sampled. They were then queried on two things:\n\n1.  Had they experienced the onset of severe chest pain in the preceding 6\n    months? (yes/no)\n2.  What was their gender? (male/female)\n\nThe data would probably have been recorded in the following format (only first\nfew rows shown):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Patient|Gender |Pain    |\n|-------:|:------|:-------|\n|       1|female |no pain |\n|       2|male   |no pain |\n|       3|female |no pain |\n|       4|male   |no pain |\n|       5|female |no pain |\n|       6|male   |pain    |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it would probably be summarised and presented in this format, which is\nknown as a *contingency table*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|       | pain| no pain|\n|:------|----:|-------:|\n|male   |   46|     474|\n|female |   37|     516|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a contingency table, each observation from the dataset falls in exactly one\nof the cells. The sum of all entries in the cells equals the number of\nindependent observations in the dataset.\n:::\n\nAll the techniques we shall touch upon in this chapter are applicable to\ncontingency tables.\n\n## Visualisations\n\n### Bar charts\n\nA common method for visualising cross combinations of categorical data is to\nuse a bar chart.\n\n::: {#exm-pol-assoc-3 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Political Association and Gender Barchart\n\n\\index{Political association!bar chart}\n\nConsider data given in the table below where both variables are nominal.

The corresponding proportion of Democrats is lower. However, note that\nthe barchart does not reflect that the marginal count for males was much less\nthan that for females.\n:::\n\nLet us turn to making bar charts with pandas and Python.\n\n::: {#exm-claritin-2 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Claritin and Nervousness Barchart\n\n\\index{Claritin!bar chart}\n\nClaritin is a drug for treating allergies. However, it has a side effect of\ninducing nervousness in patients. From a sample of 450 subjects, 188 of them\nwere randomly assigned to take Claritin, and the remaining were assigned to take\nthe placebo. The observed data was as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|         | nervous| not nervous|\n|:--------|-------:|-----------:|\n|claritin |       4|         184|\n|placebo  |       2|         260|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA barchart can be created in Python with the following code.

Let us inspect how we can make\nmosaic plots for the political association data earlier.\n\n:::: {#exm-pol-assoc-2 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Political Association and Gender Mosaic Plot\n\n\\index{Political association!mosaic plot}\n\nThe colours in @fig-r-mosaic-pol reflect the sizes of the standardised residuals.

If the response variable is the quantitative one, it makes sense to\ncreate boxplots or histograms. However, if the response variable is a the\ncategorical one, we should really be making something along these lines:\n\n::: {#exm-heart-1 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Heart Failure Dataset\n\\index{Heart failure!conditional density plot}\n\nThe dataset at [UCI\nrepository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records)\ncontains records on 299 patients who had heart failure. The data was collected\nduring the follow-up period; each patient had 13 clinical features recorded. The\nprimary variable of interest was whether they died or not. Suppose we wished to\nplot how this varied with age (a quantitative variable):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_path <- file.path(\"data\", \"heart+failure+clinical+records\", \n                       \"heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\")\nheart_failure <- read.csv(data_path)\nspineplot(as.factor(DEATH_EVENT) ~ age, data=heart_failure,\n          ylab = \"Death\", xlab=\"Age\", main=\"Proportion dying, by age\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R: Spine plot for heart failure data](04-categorical_data_analysis_files/figure-html/fig-r-spine-heart-3.png){#fig-r-spine-heart fig-align='center' width=65%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt reflects how the probability of an event varies with the quantitative\nexplanatory variable.

With contingency tables, the main inferential task\nusually relates to assessing the association between the two categorical\nvariables.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Independent Categorical Variables\"}\nIf two categorical variables are **independent**, then the joint distribution of\nthe variables would be equal to the product of the marginals. If two variables\nare not independent, we say that they are **associated**.\n:::\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we are going to discuss and apply statistical\nhypothesis tests. Refer to @sec-sig-test-proc for a quick recap about hypothesis\ntesting.\n\n### $\\chi^2$-Test for Independence\n\nThe $\\chi^2$-test uses the definition above to assess if two variables in a\ncontingency table are associated. The null and alternative hypotheses are\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nH_0 &:& \\text{The two variables are indepdendent.}  \\\\\nH_1 &:& \\text{The two variables are not indepdendent.}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, we can estimate the joint distribution from the\nobserved marginal counts. Based on this estimated joint distribution, we then\ncompute *expected* counts (which may not be integers) for each cell. The test\nstatistic essentially compares the deviation of *observed* cell counts from the\nexpected cell counts.\n\n::: {#exm-chest-pain-2 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Chest Pain and Gender Expected Counts\n\n\\index{Chest pain!expected counts}\n\nContinuing from @exm-chest-pain, we can compute the estimated marginals using\nrow and column proportions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \nchest_tab (table)\n\nSummary: \nn: 1'073, rows: 2, columns: 2\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test (cont. adj):\n  X-squared = 1.4555, df = 1, p-value = 0.2276\nFisher's exact test p-value = 0.2089\n\n                                     \n                 pain   no pain   Sum\n                                     \nmale     freq      46       474   520\n         p.row   8.8%     91.2%     .\n         p.col  55.4%     47.9% 48.5%\n                                     \nfemale   freq      37       516   553\n         p.row   6.7%     93.3%     .\n         p.col  44.6%     52.1% 51.5%\n                                     \nSum      freq      83       990 1'073\n         p.row   7.7%     92.3%     .\n         p.col      .         .     .\n                                     \n\n────────────────────\n' 95% conf. level\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the output above, ignore the $p$-values for now..

However, under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a\n$\\chi^2$ distribution with $(r-1)(c-1)$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe $\\chi^2$-test is based on a model of independence - the expected counts are\nderived under this assumption. As such, it is possible to derive residuals and\nstudy them, to see where the data deviates from this model.\n\nWe define the *standardised residuals* to be\n\n$$\nr_{ij} = \\frac{n_{ij} - \\mu_{ij}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{ij} (1 - p_{i+})(1 -p_{+j} )}}\n$$ where\n\n-   $n_{ij}$ is the observed cell count in row $i$ and column $j$ (cell $ij$).\n-   $\\mu_{ij}$ is the *expected* cell count in row $i$ and column $j$\n-   $p_{i+}$ is the marginal probability of row $i$\n-   $p_{+j}$ is the marginal probability of column $j$.\n\nThe residuals can be obtained from the test output. Under $H_0$, the residuals\nshould be close to a standard Normal distribution. If the residual for a\nparticular cell is very large (or small), we suspect that lack of fit (to the\nindependence model) arises from that cell.\n\nFor the political association table, the standardised residuals (from R) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchisq.test(political_tab)$stdres\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n              Dem        Ind        Rep\nfemale  4.5020535  0.6994517 -5.3159455\nmale   -4.5020535 -0.6994517  5.3159455\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Measures of Association\n\nThis sections covers bivariate measures of association for categorical variables.\n\n### Odds Ratio\n\nThe most generally applicable measure of association, for 2x2 tables, is the\nOdds Ratio (OR). Suppose we have $X$ and $Y$ to be Bernoulli random variables\nwith (population) success probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nWe define the odds of success for $X$ to be $$\n\\frac{p_1}{1-p_1}\n$$ Similarly, the odds of success for random variable $Y$ is\n$\\frac{p_2}{1-p_2}$.\n\nIn order to measure the strength of their association, we use the *odds ratio*:\n$$\n\\frac{p_1/ (1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}\n$$\n\nThe odds ratio can take on any value from 0 to $\\infty$.\n\n-   A value of 1 indicates no association between $X$ and $Y$. If $X$ and $Y$\n    were independent, this is precisely what we would observe.\n-   Deviations from 1 indicate stronger association between the variables.\n-   Note that, for odds ratios, deviations from 1 are not symmetric. For a given pair of\n    variables, an association of 0.25 or 4 is the same - it is just a matter of\n    which variable we put in the numerator odds.\n\nDue to the above asymmetry, we often use the log-odds-ratio instead: \n$$\n\\log \\frac{p_1/ (1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)} \n$$\n\n-   Log-odds-ratios can take values from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.\n-   A value of 0 indicates no association between $X$ and $Y$.\n-   Deviations from 0 indicate stronger association between the variables, and\n    deviations are now symmetric; a log-odds-ratio of -0.2 indicates the same\n    *strength* as 0.2, just the opposite direction.\n\nTo obtain a confidence interval for the odds-ratio, we work with the log-odds\nratio and then exponentiate the resulting interval. Here are the steps for a\n$2\\times 2$ table:\n\n1.  Suppose we label the observed counts in the table as \n    $n_{11}, n_{12}, n_{21}, n_{22}$.\n2.  The *sample* odds ratio is $$\n    \\widehat{OR} = \\frac{n_{11} \\times n_{22}}{n_{12} \\times n_{21}}\n    $$\n3.  For a large sample size, it can be shown that $\\log \\widehat{OR}$ follows a\n    Normal distribution. Hence a 95% confidence interval can be obtained through\n    $$\n    \\log \\frac{n_{11} \\times n_{22}}{n_{12} \\times n_{21}} \\pm z_{0.025} \n    \\times ASE(\\log \\widehat{OR})\n    $$\n\nwhere the ASE (Asymptotic Standard Error) of the estimator is \n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{11}} + \\frac{1}{n_{12}} + \\frac{1}{n_{21}} + \\frac{1}{n_{22}}} \n$$\n\n:::: {#exm-chest-pain-4 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Chest Pain and Gender Odds Ratio\n\n\\index{Chest pain!odds ratio}\n\nLet us compute the confidence interval for the odds ratio in the chest pain and\ngender example from earlier.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### R code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(DescTools)\nOddsRatio(chest_tab,conf.level = .95)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nodds ratio     lwr.ci     upr.ci \n 1.3534040  0.8626023  2.1234612 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Python code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nchest_tab2 = sm.stats.Table2x2(chest_array)\n\nprint(chest_tab2.summary())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n               Estimate   SE   LCB    UCB  p-value\n--------------------------------------------------\nOdds ratio        1.353        0.863 2.123   0.188\nLog odds ratio    0.303 0.230 -0.148 0.753   0.188\nRisk ratio        1.322        0.872 2.004   0.188\nLog risk ratio    0.279 0.212 -0.137 0.695   0.188\n--------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n### For Ordinal Variables\n\nWhen both variables are ordinal, it is often useful to compute the strength (or\nlack) of any monotone trend association. It allows us to assess if\n\n> As the level of $X$ increases, responses on $Y$ tend to increase toward higher\n> levels, or responses on $Y$ tend to decrease towards lower levels.\n\nFor instance, perhaps job satisfaction tends to increase as income does. In this\nsection, we shall discuss a measure for ordinal variables, analogous to\nPearson's correlation for quantitative variables, that describes the degree to\nwhich the relationship is monotone. It is based on the idea of a concordant or\ndiscordant pair of subjects.\n\n::: {#def-con-dis-1 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n-   A **pair of subjects** is *concordant* if the subject ranked higher on $X$\n    also ranks higher on $Y$.\n-   A **pair** is *discordant* if the subject ranking higher on $X$ ranks lower\n    on $Y$.\n-   A **pair** is *tied* if the subjects have the same classification on $X$\n    and/or $Y$.\n:::\n\nIf we let\n\n-   $C$: number of concordant pairs in a dataset, and\n-   $D$: number of discordant pairs in a dataset.\n\nThen if $C$ is much larger than $D$, we would have reason to believe that there\nis a strong positive association between the two variables. Here are two\nmeasures of association based on $C$ and $D$:\n\n1.  Goodman-Kruskal $\\gamma$ is computed as $$\n    \\gamma = \\frac{C - D}{C + D}\n    $$\n2.  Kendall $\\tau_b$ is $$\n    \\tau_b = \\frac{C - D}{A}\n    $$ where $A$ is a normalising constant that results in a measure that works\n    better with ties, and is less sensitive than $\\gamma$ to the cut-points\n    defining the categories. However, $\\gamma$ has the advantage that it is more easily\n    interpretable.\n\nFor both measures, values close to 0 indicate a very weak trend, while values\nclose to 1 (or -1) indicate a strong positive (negative) association.\n\n:::: {#exm-job-income-1 style=\"background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px\"}\n### Job Satisfaction by Income\n\n\\index{Job satisfaction!ordinal association}\n\nConsider the following table, obtained from @agresti2012categorical.

In Python, the measures are spread out\nacross packages.\n\nAbove, we have only scratched the surface of what is available. If you are keen,\ndo read up on\n\n1.  Somer's D (for association between nominal and ordinal)\n2.  Mutual Information (for association between all types of pairs of\n    categorical variables)\n3.  Polychoric correlation (for association between two ordinal variables)\n\nAlso, take note of how log odds ratios, $\\tau_b$ and $\\gamma$ work. Firstly,\nvalues close to 0 reflect weak association. Values of $a$ and $-a$ indicate the\nsame *strength*, but different direction of association. This allows the same\nintuition that Pearson's correlation does. When you are presented with new\nmetrics, try to understand them by asking similar questions about them.\n\n## References\n\n### Website References\n\n1.
