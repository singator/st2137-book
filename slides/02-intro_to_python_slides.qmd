## History of Python {.smaller}

* Python is a general purpose language. It does not have be compiled.
* It was originally conceived back in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum
Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.
* Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. Python 2.0 was released on October
16, 2000. Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008.
* scikit-learn, NLTK, tensorflow, keras are all in Python
* Open-source 

## Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries {.smaller}


* **Lists**, which are defined with [ ]. Lists are mutable.
* **Tuples**, which are defined with ( ). Tuples are immutable.
* **Dictionaries**,  which are defined with { }. Dictionaries have keys and 
  items. They are also mutable.

## Mutable and Immutable {.smaller}

```{python mutable-1}
x = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

The following is OK, because `x` is a list, and hence mutable:

```{python mutable-1a}
x[3] = 17     
print(x)  
```

The following will return an error, because `x_tuple` is a tuple, 
and hence immutable:

```{python mutable-2}
#| eval: false

x_tuple = (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10)
x_tuple[3] = 17 
```

## Creating Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries

Here is how we create lists, tuples and dictionaries.

```{python create-obj}
x_list = [1, 2, 3]
x_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
x_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} # access with x_dict['a']
```

## Slice Operator in Python {.smaller}

* In general, the syntax is `<list-like object>[a:b]`, where `a` and `b` are integers. 
* Such a call would return the elements at indices `a`, `a+1` until `b-1`. 
* Take note that the end point index is not included.

```{python slice-1a}
char_list = ['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
char_list[0]           # returns first element
char_list[-1]          # returns last element
```

## Slice Operator in Python {.smaller}

```{python slice-1b}
len(char_list)         # returns number of elements in list-like object.
char_list[::2]         # from first to last, every 2 apart.
```

## Mnemonic for Slice Operator

## Numpy Arrays


```{python np-1}
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array2 = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
matrix1 = np.array([array1, array2])
print(matrix1)
```

## Slice and Numpy 

The slice operator can then be used in each dimension of the matrix to subset it. 

```{python np-2}
matrix1[0, 0::3]       # returns first row, columns 1 and 4
matrix1[1, 1:3]        # returns second row, columns 2 and 3
```

## Methods for Numpy Arrays


```{python np-3}
# To obtain the dimensions of an array:
matrix1.shape
# To transpose a 2-D array
matrix1.T
```

## Adding Rows and Columns to an Array

* To combine arrays, we use the functions `vstack` and `hstack`.

```{python np-4}
np.vstack([matrix1, array1])

np.hstack([array1.reshape((5,1)), 
           array2.reshape((5,1)),
           matrix1.T])
```

## Pandas DataFrames


```{python pd-1}
import pandas as pd

data = {'X': [1,2,3,4,5,6], 'Y': [6,5,4,3,2,1]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns =['X', 'Y'])
print(df)
```

## Extracting Columns from Dataframes 

* Here is how we can extract a single column from the dataframe. 
* The resulting object is a pandas Series

```{python pd-2}
col_x = df.X
col_x[0:3]
```

## Specifying argument for header:

```{python read-1}
data1 = pd.read_table('data/crab.txt', header=0, 
                      sep="\\s+")
data1.head()
```

## Adding Column names:

```{python read-2}
varnames = ["Subject", "Gender", "CA1", "CA2", "HW"]
data2 = pd.read_table('data/ex_1.txt', header=None,  
                      names=varnames, sep="\\s+")
data2
```

## Subsetting DataFrames with Pandas

When subsetting them, we have to add either 

* `.loc` or 
* `.iloc`, 

and use it with square brackets.

The `.loc` notation is used when we wish to index rows and columns according 
to their names. The general syntax is `<DataFrame>.loc[ , ]`. A slice operator 
can be used for each row subset and column subset to be retrieved.

## Accessing with `.loc`

```{python subset-1}
# retrieve rows 0,1,2 and columns from color to width
data1.loc[0:2, 'color':'width']

# retrieve every second row starting from row 0 until row 5, and all columns
data1.loc[0:5:2, ]
```

## Accessing with `.iloc`

The general syntax is similar; try this and observe the difference with `.loc`.

```{python subset-2}
data1.iloc[0:2, 0:2]
```

## Subsetting with logical Series

```{python subset-3}
data2[data2.Gender == "M"]

data2[(data2.Gender == "M") & (data2.CA2 > 85)]
```

## General syntax for loops

* Python iterates very welll.
* Here is the general syntax:

```{python iter-1}
for i in x:
  print(f"The current element is {i}.")
```


## Example of Looping over Dictionaries

```{python iter-2}
dict1 = {'holmes': 'male', 'watson': 'male', 'mycroft': 'male', 
         'hudson': 'female', 'moriarty': 'male', 'adler': 'female'}
# dict1['hudson']

for x in dict1.keys():
    print(f"The gender of {x} is {dict1[x]}")
```

## Equivalent to R code earlier.

```{python iter-3}
x = 0          
test = True 

while test:
    x += 1  
    test = x < 6
    print(f"{x**2:2d}, {test}")
```

## Creation syntax

```{python user-fn-1}
#| eval: false
def fn_name(arguments):
  Python statements
  ...
  Returned object
```

## User-defined Function

Here is the same function as earlier, computing the circumference of a circle 
with a given radius.

```{python user-fn-2}
import math

def circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius 

circumference(1.3)
```
