## Introduction

SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a software that was originally created in
the 1960s. Today, it is widely used by statisticians working in biostatistics
and the pharmaceutical industries. Unlike Python and R, it is a proprietary 
software. The full license is quite expensive for a low-usage case such as ours.
Thankfully, there is a free web-based version that we can use for our course.

## Registering for a SAS Studio Account

The first step is to create a SAS profile: Use your *NUS email address* to register
and create your SAS profile using [this link](https://www.sas.com/profile/ui/#/create).

Once you have verified your account using the email that would be sent to you, 
the [following link](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/) should take you to the login 
page shown in @fig-sas-1.

![SAS: Login page](figs/sas_welcome-01.png){#fig-sas-1 fig-alt="SAS login" fig-align="center" width=70%}

Subsequently logging in should take you to the landing page, where you can begin 
writing SAS code and using SAS. This interface can be seen in @fig-sas-2.

## An Overview of SAS Language

The SAS language is not a fully-fledged programming language like Python is, or
even R. For the most part, we are going to capitalise on the point-and-click interface
of SAS Studio in our course. However, even so, it is good to understand a little 
about the language so that we can modify the options for different procedures as 
necessary.

A SAS program is a sequence of statements executed in order. Keep in mind that:

> Every SAS statement ends with a semicolon.

SAS programs are constructed from two basic building blocks: DATA steps and PROC
steps. A typical program starts with a DATA step to create a SAS data set and then 
passes the data to a PROC step for processing. 


::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-sas-1}

### Creating and Printing a Dataset

Here is a simple program that converts miles to kilometres in a DATA step and
then prints the results with a PROC step:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
DATA distance;
	Miles = 26.22;
	Kilometer = 1.61 * Miles;

PROC PRINT DATA=distance;
RUN;
```

To run the above program, click on the "Running Man" icon in SAS studio. You 
should obtain the output shown in @fig-sas-3.

![SAS: Simple data creation](figs/sas_ex-1.png){#fig-sas-3 fig-alt="SAS output" fig-align="center" width=70%}

This dataset has only one observation (row).

:::

*Data* steps start with the DATA keyword. This is followed by the name for the 
dataset. *Procedures* start with PROC followed by the name of the particular 
procedure (e.g. PRINT, SORT or PLOT) you wish to run on the dataset. Most SAS 
procedures have only a handful of possible statements. A step ends when SAS 
encounters a new step (marked by a DATA or PROC statement) or a RUN statement.
RUN statements are not part of a DATA or PROC step; they are global statements. 

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-sas-2}

### Creating a Dataset Inline

The following program explicitly creates a dataset within the DATA step.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
/*CREATING DATA MANUALLY:; */

DATA ex_1;
INPUT subject gender $ CA1 CA2 HW $;
DATALINES;
10 m 80 84 a
7 m 85 89 a
4 f 90 86 b
20 m 82 85 b
25 f 94 94 a
14 f 88 84 c
;

PROC MEANS DATA=ex_1;
VAR CA1 CA2;
RUN;
```

The output for the above code is shown in @fig-sas-4a and @fig-sas-4b.

::: {layout-nrow=2}
![SAS: Inline data created](figs/sas_ex-2a.png){#fig-sas-4a fig-alt="DATA output" fig-align="center" width=70%}

![SAs: PROC MEANS output](figs/sas_ex-2b.png){#fig-sas-4b fig-alt="PROC output" fig-align="center" width=70%}
:::

In the statements above, the `$`'s in the INPUT statement inform SAS that the 
preceding variables (gender and HW) are character. Note how the semi-colon for the 
DATALINES appears *after* all the data has been listed.

PROC MEANS creates basic summary statistics for the variables listed.
:::

To review, there are only 2 types of steps in SAS programs:

::: {layout-ncol=2}

#### DATA steps

- begin with DATA statements.
- read and modify data.
- create a SAS dataset.

#### PROC steps

- begin with PROC statements.
- perform specific analysis or function.
- produce reports or results.
:::

## Basic Rules for SAS Programs

### For SAS statements

* All SAS statements (except those containing data) must end with a semicolon (;).
* SAS statements typically begin with a SAS keyword. (DATA, PROC). 
* SAS statements are not case sensitive, that is, they can be entered in lowercase, 
  uppercase, or a mixture of the two.
  * Example : SAS keywords (DATA, PROC) are not case sensitive
* A delimited comment begins with a forward slash-asterisk (/*) and ends with
  an asterisk-forward slash (*/). All text within the delimiters is ignored by
  SAS.

### For SAS names

* All names must contain between 1 and 32 characters.
* The first character appearing in a name must be a letter (A, B, ... Z, a, b, ..., z) 
  or an underscore ( ). Subsequent characters must be letters, numbers, or underscores. 
  That is, no other characters, such as $, %, or & are permitted.
* Blanks also cannot appear in SAS names.
* SAS names are not case sensitive, that is, they can be entered in lowercase, 
  uppercase, or a mixture of the two. (SAS is only case sensitive within quotation marks.)

### For SAS variables

* If the variable in the INPUT statement is followed by a dollar sign ($), SAS
  assumes this is a character variable. Otherwise, the variable is considered as a
  numeric variable.


## Reading Data into SAS

In this topic, we shall introduce a new dataset, also from the UCI Machine 
Learning repository. 

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-bike-2}

### Bike Rentals
\index{Bike rentals!description}

The dataset was collected by the authors in @fanaee2013bike. It contains
information on bike-sharing rentals in Washington D.C. USA for the years 2011
and 2012, along with measurements of weather. The original dataset contained
hourly and daily aggregated data. For our class, we use a re-coded version of 
the daily data. Our dataset can be found on Canvas as `bike2.csv`.

Here is the data dictionary:

| Field       | Description                                                                                      |

| cnt         | Count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered         |

Our first step will be to load the dataset into SAS Studio.

:::


## Uploading and Using Datasets

To use our own datasets on SAS Studio, we have to execute the following steps:

1. Create a new library. In SAS, a library is a collection of datasets. If 
   you already have a library created, you can simply import datasets into it.
   The default library on SAS is called `WORK`. However, the datasets in `WORK` will be 
   purged every time you sign out. Hence it is better to create a new, dedicated 
   library for this course.
2. Import your dataset (csv, xlsx, etc.) into the library.
3. After this, the data will be available for use with the reference name
   `<library-name>.<dataset-name>`.
   
From the "Libraries" menu on the left of SAS studio, click on the "New library" 
icon (the one circled in red in @fig-sas-lib-1), and create a new library called
"ST2137". You can use the default suggested path for the library.

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![SAS: New library creation icon](figs/sas_library-02.png){#fig-sas-lib-1}

![SAS: Upload data icon](figs/sas_servers_files-02.png){#fig-sas-lib-2}
   
:::
Now expand the menu for "Server Files and Folders" and upload `bike2.csv` file
to SAS, using the circled icon in @fig-sas-lib-2.


Finally, right-click on the top of the main Studio area (where we write code)
and select "New Import Data". Select the `bike2.csv` that has just been uploaded,
and modify the OUTPUT DATA settings to Library `ST2137` and Data set name 
`BIKE2`. Click on the running man, and your dataset is now ready for use in 
SAS studio!

## Summarising Numerical Data

Most of the SAS routines we are going to work with can be found in the "Tasks
and Utilities" section (see highlighted tasks in @fig-sas-tasks-01).

![SAS: Common ST2137 procedures](figs/sas_tasks-01.png){#fig-sas-tasks-01 fig-align="center" width=30%}

### Numerical Summaries

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-bike-summ-1}

### 5-number Summaries
\index{Bike rentals!numerical summaries}

We expect that the total count of users will vary by the seasons. Hence, we begin
by computing five-number summaries for each season.

Under Tasks, go to Statistcs > Summary Statistics. Select `cnt` as the analysis
variable, and `season` as the classification variable. Under the options tab,
select the lower and upper quartiles, along with comparative boxplots. The
output should look like @fig-sas-bike-02:

![SAS: 5-number-summaries and boxplots for bike rental data](figs/sas_bike_summaries-01.png){#fig-sas-bike-02 fig-align="center" width="60%"}

We observe that the median count is highest for fall, followed by summer, winter
and lastly spring. The spreads, as measured by IQR, are similar across the
seasons: approximately 2000 users. In the middle 50%, the count distribution for
spring is the most right-skewed.

:::


### Scatter Plots

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-bike-scatter-1}

### Casual vs Registered Scatterplot
\index{Bike rentals!scatterplot}

To create a scatterplot in SAS, go to Tasks > Graphs > Scatter Plot.

Specify `casual` on the x-axis, `registered` on the y-axis, and `workingday` as 
the Group. You should observe the plot created @fig-sas-bike-01:


![SAS: Scatterplot for bike rental data](figs/sas_bike_scatter-01.png){#fig-sas-bike-01 fig-align="center" width="60%"}

We can see that there seem to be two different relationships between the 
counts of casual and registered users. The two relationships correspond to whether
it as a working day or not.

:::

### Histograms

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-bike-hist-1}

### Casual Users Distribution
\index{Bike rentals!histograms}

Now suppose we focus on casual users, and study the distribution of counts 
by whether a day is a working day or not. To create a histogram, go to 
Tasks > Graph > Histogram. Select `casual` as the analysis variable, and 
`workingday` as the group variable. 

![SAS: Histograms for bike rental data](figs/sas_bike_hist-01.png){#fig-sas-hist-01 fig-align="center" width=35%}

From @fig-sas-hist-01, we can see that the distribution is right-skewed in both
cases. However, the range of counts for non-working days extends further, to
about 3500.

:::

### Boxplots
\index{Bike rentals!boxplots}

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-bike-box-1}

### Boxplots for Casual Users, by Season

In @exm-bike-summ-1, we observed that total counts vary by season, and in 
@exm-bike-hist-1, we observed that working days seem to have fewer casual
users. Let us investigate if this difference is related to season.

To create boxplots, go to Tasks > Box Plot. Select `casual` as the analysis
variable, `season` as the category and `workingday` as the subcategory. You
should obtain the plot in @fig-sas-box-01.

![SAS: Boxplots for bike rentals, by season](figs/sas_bike_boxplot-01.png){#fig-sas-box-01 fig-align="center" width="60%"}

To order the seasons according to the calendar, I had to add this line to the
code:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
proc sgplot data=ST2137.BIKE2;
	vbox casual / category=season group=workingday grouporder=ascending;
	xaxis values=('spring' 'summer' 'fall' 'winter');
	yaxis grid;
run;
```

There is little further insight compared to the previous two examples. However,
now try the same plots, but on the log scale (modify the APPEARANCE tab and
re-run).  You should now obtain @fig-sas-box-02.

![SAS: Boxplots for bike rentals on log-scale, by season](figs/sas_bike_boxplot-02.png){#fig-sas-box-02 fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Now, we can observe that the difference within each season is constant across
seasons. Because the difference in logarithms is constant, it means that, on the
original scale, it is a constant multiplicative factor that increases counts
from workingday to non-working day.

We have arrived at a more succint representation of the relationship by using
the log transform.

:::

### QQ-plots
\index{Bike rentals!QQ plots}

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-bike-qq-1}

### Normality Check for Humidity

To create QQ-plots, we go to Tasks > Statistics > Distribution Analysis. 

Select `hum` for the analysis variable. Under options, add the normal curve, the 
kernel density estimate, and the Normal quantile-quantile plot. You should obtain
the following two charts:

::: {layout-ncol=2}
![SAS: Histogram for humidity](figs/sas_bike_qq-01.png)

![sAS: QQ-plot for humidity](figs/sas_bike_qq-02.png)
:::

The plot shows that humidity values are quite close to a Normal distribution, apart 
from a single observation on the left.

:::

## Categorical Data 

We now turn to categorical data methods with SAS. We return to the dataset on 
student performance that we used in the topic on summarising data. Upload and 
store `student-mat.csv` as ST2137.STUD_PERF on the SAS Studio website.

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-stud-chisq-1}

### $\chi^2$ Test for Independence
\index{Bike rentals!chi-squared test}

For a test of independence of `address` and `paid`, go to Tasks > Table Analysis,
and select:

* `address` as the column variable
* `paid` as the row variable.
* Under OPTIONS, check the "Chi-square statistics" box.

The output in @fig-sas-chisq-01 and @fig-sas-chisq-02 should enable you to
perform the test.

::: {layout="[[1,1], [1]]"}
![SAS: Observed & expected counts, student performance data](figs/sas_stud_chisq-01.png){#fig-sas-chisq-01}

![SAS: Test statistics and p-values for student performance data](figs/sas_stud_chisq-02.png){#fig-sas-chisq-02}

![SAS: Mosaic plot for student performance data](figs/sas_stud_mosaic-01.png){#fig-sas-mos-01}


:::

:::

For measures of association, we only need to select the option for "Measures of
Association" to generate the Kendall $\tau_b$ that we covered earlier in Chapter
4.

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-stud-chisq-1}

### Kendall $\tau$ for `Walc` and `Dalc`
\index{Student performance!Kendall's tau}

Once we load the data ST2137.STUD_PERF, we go to Tasks > Table Analysis. After 
selecting the two variables, we check the appropriate box to obtain @fig-sas-tau-01.

![SAS: Categorical variables' association, Walc by Dalc](figs/sas_stud_tau-01.png){#fig-sas-tau-01 fig-align="center" width=60%}

You may observe that the particular associations computed and returned are similar
to those by the `Desc` R package that we used in @exm-chest-pain-4.
