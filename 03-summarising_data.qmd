## Introduction

This is the first topic where we are going to see how to perform statistical
analysis using two software: R and Python. Every language has it's strengths and
weaknesses, so instead of attempting to exactly replicate the same chart/output
in each software, we shall try to understand their respective approaches better.

Our end goal is to analyse data - toward that end, we should be versatile and
adaptable. Focus on learning how to be fast and productive in whichever
environment you are told to work in. If you have a choice, then be aware of what
each framework can do best, so that you can choose the right one.

Although it is a simplistic view, the following diagram, @fig-sum-1, provides a
useful taxonomy of the types of columns we might have in our dataset. Having at
least an initial inkling of the type of data matters, because it helps decide
what type of summary to generate or what type of plot to make. Quantitative data 
are sometimes also referred to as *numerical data*.

![Data types](figs/summ_data-01.png){#fig-sum-1 fig-alt="Data types" fig-align="center" width="60%"}

There are two main ways of summarising data: numerically and graphically. This topic
will cover:

1.  Numerical summaries for univariate quantitative variables.
2.  Numerical summary for association between two quantitative variables.
3.  Useful graphs for univariate and bivariate quantitative variables.

Techniques for categorical variables will be covered in @sec-cda.

Before proceeding, let us introduce one of the datasets that we'll be using in
this textbook. The dataset comes from the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), which is a 
very useful place to get datasets for practice.

### Student Performance: Dataset Introduction
\index{Student performance!description}

The particular dataset can be downloaded from 
[this page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance). 
Once you unzip the file, you will find two `csv` files in the `student/` folder:

* `student-mat.csv` (performance in Mathematics)
* `student-por.csv` (performance in Portugese)

Each dataset was collected using school reports and questionnaires. Each row 
corresponds to a student. The columns are attributes, including student grades,
demographic information, and other social and school-related information. Each 
file corresponds to the students' performance in one of the two subjects. For more 
information, you can refer to @cortez2008using.

In the explanatory variables above, notice that also severable variables have been
stored in the dataset file using numbers, they are in fact *categorical variables*.
Examples of these are variables 24 to 29. It seems fair to treat the three output 
columns as numeric though. G3 is the main output variable.

## Numerical Summaries

Numerical summaries include:

1. Basic information about the data, e.g. number of observations and missing 
   values.
2. Measures of central tendency, e.g. mean, median
3. Measures of spread, e.g. standard deviation, IQR (interquartile range), range.

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D164; padding: 20px" #exm-stud-perf-num}

### Student Performance: Numerical Summaries
\index{Student performance!numerical summaries}

Let us read in the dataset and generate numerical summaries of the output
variable of interest (G3).

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-stud-perf-1}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
stud_perf <- read.table("data/student/student-mat.csv", sep=";", 
                        header=TRUE)
summary(stud_perf$G3)
sum(is.na(stud_perf$G3))
```

#### Python code

```{python py-stud-perf-1}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

stud_perf  = pd.read_csv("data/student/student-mat.csv", delimiter=";")
stud_perf.G3.describe()
#stud_perf.G3.info()
```

:::

From the output, we can understand that we have 395 observations, ranging from 0
to 20. I would surmise that the data is more or less symmetric in the middle 
(distance from 3rd-quartile to median is identical to distance from median to 
1st-quartile). There are no missing values in the data.

However, summaries of a single variable are rarely useful since we do not have 
a basis for comparison. In this dataset, we are interested in how the grade varies
with one or some of the *other* variables. Let's begin with Mother's education.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-stud-perf-2}
round(aggregate(G3 ~ Medu, data=stud_perf, FUN=summary), 2)
table(stud_perf$Medu)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-stud-perf-2}
stud_perf[['Medu', 'G3']].groupby('Medu').describe()
```

:::

Now we begin to understand the context of G3 a little better. As the education
level of the mother increases, the mean does increase. The middle 50-percent of
the grade does seem to increase as well. The exception is the case where the
mother has no education, but we can see that there are only 3 observations in
that category so we should read too much into it.

:::


Here are some things to note about numerical summaries: 

*   If the mean and the median are close to each other, it indicates that the distribution of 
    the data is close to symmetric.
*   The mean is sensitive outliers but the median is not. We shall see more about 
    this in @sec-robust.
*   When the mean is much larger than the median, it suggests that there could be a few very        large observations. It has resulted in a *right-skewed* distribution. Conversely, if 
    the mean is much smaller than the median, we probably have a *left-skewed* distribution. 
  
While numerical summaries provide us with some basic information about the data,
they also leave out a lot. Even for experts, it is possible to have a wrong 
mental idea about the data from the numerical summaries alone. For instance,
all three histograms in @fig-sum-2 have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1!

![Three datasets with mean 0 and s.d. 1](figs/summ_data-02.png){#fig-sum-2 fig-alt="3 histograms" fig-align="center" width="65%"}

That's why we have to turn to *graphics* as well, in order to summarise our
data.

## Graphical Summaries

### Histograms 

The first chart type we shall consider is a histogram. A histogram is a graph
that uses bars to portray the frequencies or relative frequencies of the
possible outcomes for a quantitative variable.

When we create a histogram, here are some things that we look for:

1.  *What is the overall pattern?*: Do the data cluster together, or is there a 
    gap such that one or more observations deviate from the rest?
2.  *Do the data have a single mound or peak?* If yes, then we have what is 
    known as a unimodal distribution. Data with two 'peaks' are referred to as 
    bimodal, and data with many peaks are referred to as multimodal. See @fig-hist-bimodal.
3.  *Is the distribution symmetric or skewed?* See @fig-hist-skewed-egs.
4.  *Are there any suspected outliers?* See @fig-hist-outliers.

### Student Performance: Histograms
\index{Student performance!histograms}

Now let us return to the student performance dataset.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-stud-perf-3}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "70%"
hist(stud_perf$G3, main="G3 histogram")
```

#### Python code

```{python py-stud-perf-3}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "70%"
fig = stud_perf.G3.hist(grid=False)
fig.set_title('G3 histogram');
```

:::

::: {.callout-note}
Do you notice anything different with the two histograms? 
:::

In general, we now have a little more information to accompany the 5 number summaries.
It appears that the distribution is not a basic unimodal one. There is a large 
spike of about 40 students who scored very low scores.

As we mentioned earlier, it is not useful to inspect a histogram in a silo.
Hence we shall condition on Mother's education once more, to create separate
histograms for each group. Remember that this is a case where the response
variable `G3` is quantitative, and the explanatory variable `Medu` is ordinal.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-stud-perf-4}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "80%"
library(lattice)
histogram(~G3 | Medu, data=stud_perf, type="density",
          as.table=TRUE)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-stud-perf-4}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "80%"
stud_perf.G3.hist(by=stud_perf.Medu, figsize=(15,10), density=True, 
                  layout=(2,3));
```

:::

Although the heights of the panels in the two versions are not identical, we
can, by looking at either one, see that the proportion of 0-scores reduces as
the mother's education increases. Perhaps this is reading too much into the
dataset, but there seem to be more scores on the higher end for highest educated
mothers.

:::

### Density Plots

Histograms are not perfect - when using them, we have to experiment with the bin 
size since this could mask details about the data. It is also easy to get 
distracted by the blockiness of histograms. An alternative to histograms is the
kernel density plot. Essentially, this is obtained by smoothing the heights of
the rectangles in a histogram.

Suppose we have observed an i.i.d sample $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ from a
continuous pdf $f(\cdot)$. Then the kernel density estimate at $x$ is given by

$$
\hat{f}(x)  = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^n K \left( \frac{x - x_i}{h} \right)
$$
where

*   $K$ is a density function. A typical choice is the standard normal. The kernel 
    places greater weights on nearby points (to $x$).
*   $h$ is a bandwidth, which determines which of the nearest points are used. The 
    effect is similar to the number of bins in a histogram.

### Student Performance: Density Estimates
\index{Student performance!density plots}

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-stud-perf-5}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "80%"
densityplot(~G3, groups=Medu, data=stud_perf, auto.key = TRUE, bw=1.5)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-stud-perf-5}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "80%"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, squeeze=False, figsize=(15,6))
out2 = stud_perf.groupby("Medu")
for y,df0 in enumerate(out2):
    tmp = plt.subplot(2, 3, y+1)
    df0[1].G3.plot(kind='kde')
    tmp.set_title(df0[0])
```

:::

As you can see, with density plots it is also possible to overlay them for closer
comparison. This is not possible with histograms without some transparency in the 
rectangle colours.

:::

### Boxplots 

A boxplot provides a skeletal representation of a distribution. Boxplots are
very well suited for comparing multiple groups.

Here are the steps for drawing a boxplot: 

1.  Determine $Q_1$, $Q_2$ and $Q_3$. The box is made from $Q_1$ and $Q_3$. The 
    median is drawn as a line or a dot within the box.
2.  Determine the max-whisker reach: $Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR$; the min-whisker reach by 
    $Q_1 − 1.5 \times IQR$.
3.  Any data point that is out of the range from the min to max whisker reach is 
    classified as a *potential outlier*.
4.  Excluding the potential outliers, the maximum point determines the *upper whisker* 
    and the minimum point determines the *lower whisker* of a boxplot.
   
A boxplot helps us to identify the median, lower and upper quantiles and outlier(s) 
(see @fig-sum-8).

### Student Performance: Boxplots
\index{Student performance!boxplots}

Instead of using mother's education once again, we use the number of times a 
student goes out (`goout`) as the explanatory variable this time. From the
boxplot outputs, it appears there is no strong strictly increasing/decreasing 
trend associated with G3. Instead, although the differences between the 
categories are not large, it seems as though there is an "optimal" number of 
times that students could go out. Too little and too much leads to lower median
G3 scores.

### QQ-plots

Finally, we turn to QQ-plots. A Quantile-Quantile plot is a graphical diagnostic 
tool for assessing if a dataset follows a particular distribution. Most of the time
we would be interested in comparing against a Normal distribution. 

A QQ-plot plots the standardized sample quantiles against the theoretical
quantiles of a N(0; 1) distribution. If they fall on a straight line, then we
would say that there is evidence that the data came from a normal distribution.

Especially for unimodal datasets, the points in the middle will typically fall
close to the line. The value of a QQ-plot is in judging if the tails of the data
are fatter or thinner than the tails of the Normal.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-qq-1
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "QQ-plots"
#| fig-subcap:
#|  - "Thinner than Normal"
#|  - "Fatter than Normal"
set.seed(2137)
X <- runif(100)
qqnorm(X, main="Both tails thinner than Normal")
qqline(X)

Y <- rt(100, df=2)
qqnorm(Y, main="Both tails fatter than Normal")
qqline(Y)

```

::: {.callout-note}
Please be careful! Some software/packages will switch the axes (i.e. plot the
sample quantiles on the x-axis instead of the y-axis, unlike @fig-qq-1). Please
observe and interpret accordingly.

### Concrete Slump: Dataset Introduction
\index{Concrete slump!description}

Concrete is a highly complex material. The slump flow of concrete is not only
determined by the water content, but that is also influenced by other concrete
ingredients. The UCI page for this dataset is
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/182/concrete+slump+test). The reference
for this article is @yeh2007modeling.

The data set includes 103 data points. There are 7 input variables, and 3 output
variables in the data set. These are the input columns in the data, all in 
units of kg per $m^3$ concrete:

| #   | Feature              | Details                                   |
|-----|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Cement               |                                           |
| 2   | Slag                 |                                           |
| 3   | Fly ash              |                                           |
| 4   | Water                |                                           |
| 5   | SP                   | A super plasticizer to improve consistency. |
| 6   | Coarse Aggr.         |                                           |
| 7   | Fine Aggr.           |                                           |

There are three output variables in the dataset. You can read more 
about Slump and Flow from this 
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_slump_test).

| #   | Feature                     | Units             |
|-----|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| 1   | SLUMP                       | cm                |
| 2   | FLOW                        | cm                |
| 3   | 28-day Compressive Strength | MPa               |

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

To read in the data in R:

```{r}
concrete <- read.csv("data/concrete+slump+test/slump_test.data")
names(concrete)[c(1,11)] <- c("id", "Comp.Strength")
```

#### Python code

```{python}
concrete = pd.read_csv("data/concrete+slump+test/slump_test.data")
concrete.rename(columns={'No':'id', 
                         'Compressive Strength (28-day)(Mpa)':'Comp_Strength'},  
                inplace=True)
```


:::

:::

Let us consider the Comp.Strength output variable. The histogram overlay
in @fig-concrete-1 suggests some skewness and fatter tails than the Normal.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "70%"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: Comparing data with reference Normal (blue)
#| label: fig-concrete-1

hist(concrete$Comp.Strength, freq = FALSE)
dens_out <- density(concrete$Comp.Strength)
lines(dens_out$x, dens_out$y, col="red")

x_mean <- mean(concrete$Comp.Strength)
x_sd <- sd(concrete$Comp.Strength)
x_vals <- seq(10, 65, by=0.5)
y_vals <- dnorm(x_vals, mean=x_mean, sd=x_sd)
lines(x_vals, y_vals, col="blue", lty=2)
```

### Concrete: QQ-plots
\index{Concrete slump!QQ plots}

The next chart is a QQ-plot, for assessing deviations from Normality.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-concrete-1}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "70%"
qqnorm(concrete$Comp.Strength)
qqline(concrete$Comp.Strength)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-concrete-1}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "70%"
from scipy import stats
import statsmodels.api as sm
sm.qqplot(concrete.Comp_Strength, line="q");
```

:::

The deviation of the tails does not seem to be that large, judging from the QQ-plot.

## Correlation 

When we are studying two quantitative variables, the most common numerical
summary to quantify the relationship between them is the correlation
coefficient. Suppose that $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ are two
variables from a set of $n$ objects or people. The sample correlation between
these two variables is computed as:

$$
r = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}
$$
where $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the sample standard deviations. $r$ is an estimate of 
the correlation between random variables $X$ and $Y$.

::: {layout-nrow=2}
![Linear Relation](figs/summ_data-06.png){#fig-corr-linear fig-align=center out-width=50%}

![Non-linear relation](figs/summ_data-07.png){#fig-corr-non-linear fig-align=center out-width=50%}
:::

A few things to note about the value $r$, which is also referred to as the 
Pearson correlation:

*   $r$ is always between -1 and 1.
*   A positive value for $r$ indicates a positive association and a negative value for 
    $r$ indicates a negative association.
*   Two variables have the same correlation, no matter which one is coded as $X$ and
    which one is coded as $Y$.

@fig-corr-linear and @fig-corr-non-linear contain sample plots of data and their 
corresponding $r$ values. Notice how $r$ does not reflect strong non-linear 
relationships.

## Scatterplot Matrices

### Concrete: Scatterplots

When we have multiple quantitative variables in a dataset, it is common to 
create a matrix of scatterplots. This allows for simultaneous inspection of 
bivariate relationships.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-concrete-2}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 12
col_to_use <- c("Cement", "Slag", "Comp.Strength", "Water", "SLUMP.cm.",
                "FLOW.cm.")
pairs(concrete[, col_to_use], panel = panel.smooth)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-concrete-3}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(concrete[['Cement', 'Slag', 'Comp_Strength', 'Water', 
                                     'SLUMP(cm)', 'FLOW(cm)']], 
                           figsize=(12,12));
```

:::

We can see that a few of the variables have several 0 values - cement, slag, slump and 
flow. Water appears to have some relation with slump and with flow.

The scatterplots allow a visual understanding of the patterns, but it is usually 
also good to compute the correlation of all pairs of variables. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-concrete-3}
#| fig-align: center
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 5

library(psych)
corPlot(cor(concrete[, col_to_use]), cex=0.8, show.legend = FALSE)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-concrete-4}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
corr = concrete[['Cement', 'Slag', 'Comp_Strength', 'Water', 
                 'SLUMP(cm)', 'FLOW(cm)']].corr()
corr.style.background_gradient(cmap='coolwarm_r')
```

:::

The plots you see above are known as heatmaps. They enable us to pick out 
groups of variables that are similar to one another. As you can see from the 
blue block in the lower right corner, `Water`, `SLUMP.cm` and `FLOW.cm` are 
very similar to one another.
